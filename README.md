Deep Dive Analysis Using Python (Jupyter Notebook) ğŸ‘‰ CLICK FILE ABOVE FOR PROJECT ğŸ‘ˆ

Does the number of years employed have any direct correlation to the overall number of employees retained vs left. 
Is there a point in which x-amount years employeed has a significant shift of employees leaving the company vs 
retained. Our analysis will consists upon the bases of two clear distinctions, where years employeed (>=5 and <=5)
The purpose of this project is to determine if there are any correlations with hours worked, projects completed, 
and satisfaction levels amongst employees. Once our analysis is complete, we will take another step by seperating 
our analysis into departments in order to create insights to see if there are any correlations amongst departments 

Core of analysis will be looking into 3 key columns:
- Satisfaction levels
- Number of projects completed
- Average monthly hours worked

Core of project will be split between:
Years employed greater or equal to 5 years vs less or equal to 5 years + results grouped by departments further into analysis

Tools used in project include the following:
Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Techniques used in project include the following: 
Filtering dataframe/columns, checking missing values, checking positive/negative correlations, visualizing comparison with box plots/line graphs/bar graphs, potential outliers
 
This was a very fun project I completed for my final capstone 
Result of analysis will be interesting to say the least
I hope you enjoy my long thorough analysis
