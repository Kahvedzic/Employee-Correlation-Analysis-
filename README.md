# Deep Dive Analysis Using Python (Jupyter Notebook)

Core of analysis will be looking at 3 key columns:
- Satisfaction levels
- Number of projects completed
- Average monthly hours worked

Core of project will also be split between:
- Years employed greater or equal to 5 years vs less or equal to 5 years 
- Results will also be grouped by departments further into project for deeper analysis

Tools used in project include the following:
Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Techniques used in project include the following: 

Preparing data- filtering dataframe/columns, missing values, outliers

Visualizing data - positive/negative correlations, box plots/line graphs/bar graphs
 
Result of analysis will be interesting to say the least
