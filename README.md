# Project Background

Does the number of years employed have any direct correlation to the overall number of employees retained vs left.
Is there a point in which x-amount years employeed has a significant shift of employees leaving the company vs
retained. Our analysis will consists upon the bases of two clear distinctions, where years employeed (>=5 and <=5)
The purpose of this project is to determine if there are any correlations with hours worked, projects completed,
and satisfaction levels amongst employees. Once our analysis is complete, we will take another step by seperating
our analysis into departments in order to create insights to see if there are any correlations amongst departments.

Insights and recommendations are provided on the following key areas:

* Create summary statistics for each variable needed.
* Visualize the left vs retained results based on >=5 and <=5 years employed.
* Visualize the correlations with variables SATISFACTION LEVELS, NUMBER PROJECTS, AVERAGE MONTHLY HOURS.
* Visualize the correlations with same variables grouped by DEPARTMENT.

Prior to beginning of analysis, familiarization with the dataset was used for quality control.

# Executive Summary

Overview of findings: 

Summary: Time spent with the company results.

Where years employed >=5.
* Left the company: 80% at 5 years, 20 % at 6 years.
* Retained: 37% at 5 years, 30% at 6 years, 12% at 10 years, 11% at 7 years, 9% at 8 years.

Where years employed <=5.
* Left the company: 47% at 3 years, 26% at 4 years, 25% at 5 years, 2% at 2 years.
* Retained: 47% at 3 years, 31% at 2 years, 16% at 4 years, 1% at 5 years.
