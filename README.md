# Project Background


Does the number of years employed have any direct correlation to the overall number of employees retained vs left.
Is there a point in which x-amount years employeed has a significant shift of employees leaving the company vs
retained. Our analysis will consists upon the bases of two clear distinctions, where years employeed (>=5 and <=5)
The purpose of this project is to determine if there are any correlations with hours worked, projects completed,
and satisfaction levels amongst employees. Once our analysis is complete, we will take another step by seperating
our analysis into departments in order to create insights to see if there are any correlations amongst departments

Insights and recommendations are provided on the following key areas:

* Create summary statistics for each variable needed
* Visualize the left vs retained results based on >=5 and <=5 years employed
* Visualize the correlations with variables SATISFACTION LEVELS, NUMBER PROJECTS, AVERAGE MONTHLY HOURS
* Visualize the correlations with same variables grouped by DEPARTMENT

Core of analysis will be looking at 3 key columns:
- Satisfaction levels
- Number of projects completed
- Average monthly hours worked

Core of project will also be split between:
- Years employed greater or equal to 5 years vs less or equal to 5 years 
- Results will also be grouped by departments further into project for deeper analysis

Tools used in project include the following:
Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Techniques used in project include the following: 

Preparing data- filtering dataframe/columns, missing values, outliers

Visualizing data - positive/negative correlations, box plots/line graphs/bar graphs
